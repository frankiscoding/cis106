### What is GitHub?

GitHub is hosted by Git and adds more useful features to Git. But GitHub is most known for as a diverse community of developers working together to complete different projects of code. 

Some benefits of GitHub are:
* **Tracks your changes** -- Which means that you can always see what changes were made and what time they were made. Which is very beneficial both ways since if a mistake was made, you can revert back to a previous version of the project.
* **Flexible** -- GitHub allows you to work locally or through a team on your projects
* **Website** -- GitHub is a website which makes everyone's lives easier and makes it very easy to access projects or other developers
* **Trunk Based Development** -- From a developer's perspective, you're able to sort of branch off into different areas with the code and experiment different ways, all while still being able to dip in and out of the main code.

GitHub is very useful and is highly recommended for new or experienced developers. One more thing to note is that GitHub has its own repository, which is a cloud for any saved or collaborated projects.
